# ASIN-Search-Helper
Lightweight application that helps you open Amazon pages by selecting ASINs and pressing a button combination, written on AHK

# Who is it for?
If you need to open Amazon detail pages (or "dp", you know, the actual product page) often. For example, you are an amazon seller and want to see if the corrections you submitted yesterday are already live, or you work at an ecommerce agency or something like that.

# How does it work?
1. Select an ASIN or a list of ASINs (you can select a list in excel, or simply highlight one after typing it-- the program you do this on doesn't matter).
2. Press Shift +F2 and the little pop up will appear asking you which amazon site you want to open.
3. As you can see you can also select and open Vendor Central and Seller Central Case IDs, and I even added one function to pin the current window on top of everything (useful when you're chatting with amazon support!)

# Can I edit the code myself?
Of course! The code is under the GNU license. Basically, as long as you give credit to me it's perfectly fine, go nuts. 

# I'm not a coder, can I suggest an edit?
Not a coder either, but sure, if you think something can be improved or fixed let me know.

# Can we use this on Mac/Linux/a phone/my grandma's toaster?
I wrote this on AHK which is a Windows only programming software (well, more like a scripting/automation tool). I have plans to rewrite this on python so it's platform agnostic but I don't have time at the moment. Hopefully soon!

Remember you can donwload the latest exe form the Releases page and the code is in the ahk file! have fun!
